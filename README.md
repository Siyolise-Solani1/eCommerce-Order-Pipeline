# data-engineering
This is a mini project to build a real-world DATA ENGINEERING PROJECT, E-Commerce Order Monitoring Pipeline using just Snowflake, dbt, and Apache Airflow. I simulate order data, load it into Snowflake, transform it with dbt, and orchestrate everything using Airflow — complete with SLA alerting for delayed orders.

STEP BY STEP PROCESS:
1. SYSTEM DESIGN
2. DUMMY DATA CREATION using Python (Pandas)
3. CREATING FREE SNOWFLAKE ACCOUNT
4. LOADING DATA INTO SNOWFLAKE
5. dbt and profiles setup
6. dbt FOLDER STRUCTURE
7. dbt TRANSFORMATION CODING using SQL
8. PYTHON VIRTUAL ENV SETUP
9. AIRFLOW SETUP AND WRITING DAG AND USING AIRFLOW UI
10. SETTING EMAIL ALERTS
