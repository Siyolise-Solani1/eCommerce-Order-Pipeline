# data-engineering
This is a mini project to build a real-world DATA ENGINEERING PROJECT, E-Commerce Order Monitoring Pipeline using just Python, Snowflake, dbt, and Apache Airflow. I simulate order data, load it into Snowflake, transform it with dbt, and orchestrate everything using Airflow — complete with SLA alerting for delayed orders.

STEP BY STEP PROCESS:

DUMMY DATA CREATION using Python (Pandas)
CREATING FREE SNOWFLAKE ACCOUNT
LOADING DATA INTO SNOWFLAKE
dbt and profiles setup
dbt FOLDER STRUCTURE
dbt TRANSFORMATION CODING
PYTHON VIRTUAL ENV SETUP
AIRFLOW SETUP AND WRITING DAG AND USING AIRFLOW UI
SETTING EMAIL ALERTS
